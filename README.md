**Overview**

This project is a backend system built using Java and Spring Boot with microservices architecture powered by Spring Cloud. It integrates various technologies such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, ElasticSearch for full-text search, MongoDB and MySQL for data storage, and payment gateway integration for secure financial transactions.

**Features**

**JWT Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization using JWT.

**ElasticSearch:** Full-text search capabilities for efficient and fast data retrieval.

**MongoDB:** A NoSQL database to store unstructured or semi-structured data.

**MySQL:** A relational database to store structured data.

**Payment Integration:** Integration with popular payment gateways for handling transactions securely.

**Technologies Used**

**Spring Boot:** Web framework to develop the backend services.

**Spring Cloud:** For building microservices with distributed systems.

**JWT (JSON Web Token):** Token-based authentication for secure user login.

**ElasticSearch:** Distributed search engine used to index and search data.

**MongoDB:** NoSQL database for flexible data storage.
